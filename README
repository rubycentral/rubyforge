This is a port of the RubyForge codebase to Rails.  It's about time!

Some plans:

we'll migrate existing data over; e.g., we're not tied to current rubyforge schema
What domain data will we keep? (see table listing further down)
- User
- Membership
- Group
- Project
- Forum
- Message
- NewsByte (would be good to decouple this from Forums)
- MailingList
- Tracker (currently this is artifact)
- TrackerItem
- Role

Architecture:
Apache, Rails, Memcached, Redis, Resque, PostgreSQL
